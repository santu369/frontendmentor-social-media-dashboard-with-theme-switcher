## My process

Worked on Mobile first approach, then added media queries, adjusting the layout.
Used React for building the app using component based approach and Bootstrap for layout.
Split the code into as many reusable components as possible.

Used prefers-color-scheme for dark/light mode toggle using custom data attribute.
If user has selected dark mode in browser color preferences, code will automatically detect it and change the display to dark mode. The app watches for changes in the browser coloe preferences, if after opening the app, user changes color preference in browser settings, app will change to selected color mode. If user choses to change mode using the toggle, this is stored in local storage of the browser and takes precedence over browser color preference.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology
- SASS
- Bootstrap
- React
- Clip-path animation

### What I learned

Adding simple clip-path animation to the application on the toggle.
Using prefers-color-scheme media query and applying in react.
Setting dark/light mode based on browser color preferences set by user.
Adding toggle functionality to change between dark and light modes.

### Continued development

Continue working on more full page designs in frontendmentor using react.
